/// Insert V_NOPs for MI400/gfx1250 multicycle co-execution data hazards.
///
/// On gfx1250 WMMA/SWMMAC (XDL) and TRANS instructions co-execute with other
/// VALU on separate sub-pipelines. Hardware cannot detect data hazards between
/// co-executing instructions, so software must space a producer and a dependent
/// consumer by a number of VALU-pipe slots (independent VALU or V_NOP). This
/// pass performs a forward walk with a bounded backward scan and inserts the
/// missing V_NOPs before each hazard consumer.
///
/// Hazards handled (only when a VGPR range actually overlaps):
///   - WMMA -> WMMA, prev D feeds A/B (or SWMMAC index): 1 + coexec slots
///   - WMMA -> co-executable VALU (RAW/WAR/WAW on D/A/B):    coexec slots
///   - WMMA -> WMMA, prev D feeds C (accumulation):          0 (HW forwards)
///   - TRANS -> TRANS / TRANS -> XDL WMMA:                   1
///   - TRANS -> core/side VALU:                              0 (HW handles)
///
/// The coexec slot count is read directly from the producer's HwInstDesc
/// coIssueWindow bitmask: popcount(coIssueWindow) == coexec slots. WMMA->VALU
/// needs that many slots; WMMA->WMMA needs one more.
///
/// DISABLE_XDL_ARB_STALL awareness: the pass tracks the SCHED_MODE arb-stall
/// bit during the walk. When co-execution is disabled (arb-stall set — the
/// normal gfx1250 case, emitted by TensileLite) the reduced counts apply:
/// WMMA->WMMA = 1, WMMA->VALU = 0.
///
/// Pre-existing V_NOPs (e.g. TensileLite's) are counted as existing slots and
/// never stripped. Runs whole-kernel, AFTER InsertWaitAluPass (s_wait_alu are
/// not VALU and must already be placed) and BEFORE InsertDelayAluPass.
///
/// The module overload reaches callee Functions; the no-argument overload
/// (stinkytofu-opt single-pass mode, unit tests) processes only the given
/// Function.
