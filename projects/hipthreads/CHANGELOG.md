* Email notifications for CI workflow runs (#61).

### Changed

* Install public headers under a `hipthreads/` subdirectory (#107).
* Use `ROCM_PATH` in the top-level CMake build, and in the examples with an `/opt/rocm` fallback (#107).

* Updated the CPU InOneWeekend Raytracer samples to avoid virtual functions for better performance (#96).

### Resolved issues

* Fixed duplicate `hipthreads` linking in `test/CMakeLists.txt` that caused device-side duplicate symbol errors (#105).
* Applied a placement-new workaround for a ROCm 7.12 compiler bug in the examples (#107).
* Fixed the libhipcxx include path for the CI build on TheRock 7.12 (#76).

## hipThreads 0.1.0 for ROCm 7.0.2

Initial early-access technology preview of hipThreads — a C++-style concurrency library that brings `std::thread`-like primitives to AMD GPUs.
This first release establishes the core library and its supporting infrastructure:

* `std::thread`-style concurrency primitives that run inside GPU kernels: `hip::thread`, `hip::mutex`, `hip::lock_guard`, `hip::condition_variable`, and the cooperative `pseudo_*` variants.
* Persistent scheduler kernel with host- and device-side work submission, and multi-fiber (SIMD `width`) execution support.
* CMake build (native HIP language support), a `lit`-based test suite, and a CI/CD workflow.
* Example projects demonstrating incremental CPU to GPU ports (saxpy, InOneWeekend Raytracer, sparse matrix multiplication, and llama3.c).
* Initial documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`, and Doxygen configuration).
