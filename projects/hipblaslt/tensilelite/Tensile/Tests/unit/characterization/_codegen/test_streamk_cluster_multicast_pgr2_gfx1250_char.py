"""StreamK DP cooperative B-multicast, double-buffered prologue prefetch
(PrefetchGlobalRead=2) -- gfx1250 characterization (CPU-only).

Companion to ``test_streamk_cluster_multicast_gfx1250_char.py`` (which pins
PrefetchGlobalRead=1). This exercises the ``PrefetchGlobalRead=2`` path with
K > DepthU, so the prologue emits the second, double-buffered ("LDS1")
cooperative multicast prefetch load. That prefetch load is emitted inside the
single-iteration guard branch, past the generic per-load cluster-barrier
bracketing boundary, so ``StreamK.streamKMulticastProloguePrefetchHandshake``
must bracket it with a dedicated cluster-scope split-barrier handshake.

Asserts, in addition to the sibling config's split-mask / predicate checks:
  * the double-buffered prologue prefetch load is bracketed by a wave-0-elected
    cluster-scope ``s_barrier_signal -3`` + ``s_barrier_wait -3`` handshake
    (label ``SKMC_SkipPrefetchSignal``); and
  * the cluster-scope split barrier stays balanced: every ``s_barrier_signal -3``
    is matched by an ``s_barrier_wait -3``.

CPU-only: no GPU required.
